# Beta_VAE
This is a repo for my individual interest to understand Beta_vae, based on its ability to unentangle embedded representation.
For orginal paper:
beta-VAE: Learning Basic Visual Concepts with a Constrained Variational Framework
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy2fzU9gl

More understanding of the theory:
Understanding disentangling in β-VAE
https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03599

This version is the DeepMind of β-VAE.

The data utilized for β-VAE experimentation is from dsprites (from https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset).

Please init through python main.py
